# Office 365 Calendar Connector - Jira Tickets

This directory contains the Jira-style tickets for implementing the Office 365 Calendar connector for Airbyte/Faros.

## Overview

The Office 365 Calendar connector will be a drop-in replacement for the Google Calendar connector, providing the same configuration options, sync behaviors, and data schemas while using Microsoft Graph API instead of Google Calendar API.

## Ticket Structure

Each ticket follows a standard Jira format with:
- **User Story**: Business value and user perspective
- **Description**: Technical details and context
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific conditions for completion
- **Tasks**: Detailed checklist of implementation steps
- **Definition of Done**: Quality gates and completion criteria
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisite tickets
- **Estimate**: Story points for effort estimation

## Implementation Order

The tickets are designed to be implemented in sequence:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tickets 1-3)
1. **O365CAL-001**: Project Setup and Initial Structure (2 points)
2. **O365CAL-002**: Configuration Specification and TypeScript Models (3 points)
3. **O365CAL-003**: Authentication and API Client Implementation (8 points)

### Phase 2: Stream Implementation (Tickets 4-6)
4. **O365CAL-004**: Calendars Stream Implementation (5 points)
5. **O365CAL-005**: Events Stream Basic Implementation (8 points)
6. **O365CAL-006**: Events Stream Incremental Sync Implementation (8 points)

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Tickets 7-8)
7. **O365CAL-007**: Main Source Class and Entry Point Implementation (5 points)
8. **O365CAL-008**: Comprehensive Testing Implementation (10 points)

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Tickets 9-10)
9. **O365CAL-009**: Documentation and Final Validation (5 points)
10. **O365CAL-010**: Destination Converter Validation and Enhancement (5 points)

## Total Effort Estimate

**Total Story Points**: 59 points

Based on typical team velocity, this represents approximately 6-8 weeks of development effort for one developer, or 3-4 weeks for a pair of developers.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Authentication**: OAuth2 client credentials flow (following Azure AD connector pattern)
- **API**: Microsoft Graph API v1.0
- **Incremental Sync**: Delta queries with fallback to full refresh
- **Data Mapping**: Convert Office 365 fields to match Google Calendar schema exactly
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests with mock API responses

## Success Criteria

The completed connector should:
- Be a drop-in replacement for Google Calendar connector
- Support the same configuration options and sync modes
- Provide identical data output format for seamless Faros integration
- Handle large-scale enterprise calendar data efficiently
- Include comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides

## Dependencies

- Microsoft Graph API access and appropriate permissions
- Azure App Registration for authentication
- Test Microsoft 365 tenant for validation (optional but recommended)

## Notes

- Each ticket includes detailed task checklists for implementation
- Error handling and edge cases are addressed throughout
- Performance considerations are built into the design
- Security best practices are incorporated from the start
