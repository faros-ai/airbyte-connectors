# O365CAL-009: Documentation and Final Validation

## User Story
As a user and developer, I want comprehensive documentation for the Office 365 Calendar connector so that I can easily set it up, configure it, and troubleshoot issues.

## Description
Create complete documentation including setup guides, configuration instructions, troubleshooting, and perform final validation to ensure the connector is production-ready.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete README with setup and configuration instructions
- [ ] Microsoft Graph API permissions documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] All tests pass and build succeeds
- [ ] Connector works with actual Microsoft 365 tenant (if available)
- [ ] Documentation follows the same format as Google Calendar connector

## Tasks
### README Documentation
- [ ] Create/update `README.md` with comprehensive guide:
  - Overview and purpose of the connector
  - Prerequisites and requirements
  - Installation instructions
  - Configuration parameter explanations
  - Example configuration JSON
  - Supported sync modes and streams
  - Data schema documentation
- [ ] Include comparison with Google Calendar connector
- [ ] Add links to relevant Microsoft documentation

### Microsoft Graph Setup Guide
- [ ] Document required Microsoft Graph API permissions:
  - `Calendar.Read.All` for organization-wide access
  - `User.Read.All` for domain-wide delegation
  - Alternative minimal permissions for specific use cases
- [ ] Step-by-step Azure App Registration guide:
  - Creating app registration in Azure portal
  - Generating client secret
  - Configuring API permissions
  - Admin consent requirements
- [ ] Domain-wide delegation setup instructions
- [ ] Security best practices and recommendations

### Configuration Guide
- [ ] Document all configuration parameters:
  - Required: `client_id`, `client_secret`, `tenant_id`
  - Optional: `calendar_ids`, `domain_wide_delegation`, `events_max_results`, `cutoff_days`
- [ ] Provide example configurations for different scenarios:
  - Single user calendar access
  - Organization-wide calendar access
  - Specific calendar IDs only
  - Different time ranges and limits
- [ ] Configuration validation and error messages

### Troubleshooting Guide
- [ ] Document common issues and solutions:
  - Authentication failures (invalid credentials)
  - Permission errors (insufficient Graph API permissions)
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - Delta token expiration and full refresh fallback
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Large dataset handling
- [ ] Error code explanations and remediation steps
- [ ] Performance optimization tips
- [ ] Debugging and logging guidance

### Integration Test Implementation
- [ ] Set up controlled test environment:
  - Create dedicated Microsoft 365 test tenant
  - Configure test user with known calendars and events
  - Set up CI/CD environment variables for secure testing
  - Create test data fixtures with predictable content
- [ ] Implement progressive integration test suite:
  - **Phase 1: Authentication Tests**
    - Valid credential authentication and token acquisition
    - Invalid credential error handling and messaging
    - Token refresh and expiration scenarios
    - Connection timeout and retry mechanisms
  - **Phase 2: Calendar Discovery Tests**
    - List all accessible calendars in test tenant
    - Verify known test calendars are discovered
    - Test calendar filtering with specific calendar_ids
    - Validate calendar metadata mapping (name, owner, permissions)
  - **Phase 3: Event Extraction Tests**
    - Full refresh sync from known calendar with expected event count
    - Date range filtering with cutoff_days parameter
    - Large dataset handling (calendars with 1000+ events)
    - Event metadata validation (attendees, location, recurrence)
  - **Phase 4: Incremental Sync Tests**
    - Perform initial full sync and capture state
    - Create new test events and verify delta detection
    - Modify existing events and verify change detection
    - Delete test events and verify deletion handling
    - Test delta token expiration and fallback to full refresh
  - **Phase 5: Error Scenario Tests**
    - Network failure simulation and recovery
    - Rate limiting handling and exponential backoff
    - Malformed API response handling
    - Permission denial scenarios and graceful degradation
    - Large dataset memory usage and streaming validation

### Test Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Create integration test configuration:
  ```typescript
  interface IntegrationTestConfig {
    tenant_id: string;
    client_id: string;
    client_secret: string;
    test_user_email: string;
    known_calendar_ids: string[];
    expected_event_counts: Record<string, number>;
    test_calendar_with_large_dataset: string;
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement test data management:
  - Known test calendars with controlled event sets
  - Test event creation/deletion utilities
  - Data verification helpers for expected vs actual results
  - Cleanup procedures for test isolation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD integration testing:
  - Secure credential management for test environment
  - Automated test execution on pull requests
  - Performance benchmarking and regression detection
  - Test result reporting and failure analysis

### Real Environment Validation
- [ ] Run complete test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Verify build process: `npm run build`
- [ ] Run linting and fix issues: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Execute integration test suite with real Microsoft 365 tenant:
  - Verify all authentication scenarios pass
  - Confirm calendar discovery works with test data
  - Validate event extraction accuracy and completeness
  - Test incremental sync with controlled data changes
  - Measure performance with realistic data volumes (100+ calendars, 10,000+ events)

### Integration Validation
- [ ] Test integration with Faros destination converters:
  - Verify existing Google Calendar converters work with mapped data
  - Test data flow through complete pipeline
  - Validate dashboard compatibility
- [ ] Verify connector follows Airbyte protocol correctly
- [ ] Test CLI functionality and error handling

### Performance and Scale Testing
- [ ] Test with large calendar datasets (if possible)
- [ ] Validate memory usage and performance
- [ ] Test concurrent calendar processing
- [ ] Verify incremental sync efficiency

### Code Quality and Standards
- [ ] Code review for consistency with repository patterns
- [ ] Verify TypeScript types are complete and accurate
- [ ] Ensure error handling follows established patterns
- [ ] Validate logging and observability
- [ ] Check for security best practices
