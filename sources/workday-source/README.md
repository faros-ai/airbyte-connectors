## Custom Reports:
When providing a Custom Report, please use the "Worker Data" setting. 
Export the report to a JSON file which will be a list of employee records,
all of which have similar fields. Among those specific field names,
in order to use the destination, we require the field names to contain the following:
(? implies optional):
```
  Start_Date: Date;
  Full_Name: string;
  Employee_ID: string;
  Manager_Name: string;
  Manager_ID: string;
  Team_ID: string;
  Team_Name: string;
  Termination_Date?: Date;
  Location?: string;
  Email?: string;
  Employee_Type?: string;
```
For the Custom Report, the conventional credentials are a username and password.
You can optionally include OAuth using a clientId, a clientSecret, and a refreshToken.
