# O365CAL-010: Destination Converter Validation and Enhancement

## User Story
As a user, I want the Office 365 Calendar data to integrate seamlessly with existing Faros dashboards and analytics so that I can get insights immediately without additional configuration.

## Description
Verify that existing Google Calendar destination converters work with Office 365 Calendar data, and create Office 365-specific converters if needed to ensure perfect integration with the Faros platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Existing Google Calendar converters tested with Office 365 data
- [ ] Data mapping ensures seamless integration with Faros data model
- [ ] Office 365-specific converters created if needed
- [ ] Calendar and event data flows correctly through complete pipeline
- [ ] Faros dashboards work with Office 365 calendar data
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for typical data volumes

## Tasks
### Existing Converter Validation
- [ ] Test existing Google Calendar converters with mapped Office 365 data:
  - Test `destinations/airbyte-faros-destination/src/converters/googlecalendar/calendars.ts`
  - Test `destinations/airbyte-faros-destination/src/converters/googlecalendar/events.ts`
  - Verify field mappings work correctly
  - Test with various event types and scenarios
- [ ] Validate data type conversions and transformations
- [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Ensure no data loss during conversion

### Field Mapping Verification
- [ ] Verify all Office 365 fields map correctly to Faros schema:
  - Calendar metadata (name, description, owner)
  - Event details (subject, description, times, location)
  - Attendee information and roles
  - Event status and visibility
  - Recurrence patterns and exceptions
- [ ] Test time zone handling and conversion
- [ ] Validate date/time format consistency

### Office 365-Specific Converters (if needed)
- [ ] Create Office 365-specific converter directory if required:
  - `destinations/airbyte-faros-destination/src/converters/office365calendar/`
- [ ] Implement Office 365 calendar converter:
  - Handle Office 365-specific calendar types
  - Map permission and sharing settings
  - Convert owner and access information
- [ ] Implement Office 365 event converter:
  - Handle Office 365-specific event properties
  - Map Teams meeting information
  - Convert sensitivity and classification data
  - Handle Office 365 attendee response types

### Data Quality Validation
- [ ] Test data quality and completeness:
  - Verify all important fields are preserved
  - Test with various calendar and event configurations
  - Validate recurring event handling
  - Test deleted event processing
- [ ] Compare data quality with Google Calendar connector
- [ ] Ensure no regression in data fidelity

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete data pipeline:
  - Office 365 source → Airbyte → Faros destination
  - Verify data appears correctly in Faros database
  - Test with both full refresh and incremental sync
  - Validate state persistence across syncs
- [ ] Test with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Verify performance meets expectations

### Dashboard Compatibility
- [ ] Test existing Faros dashboards with Office 365 calendar data:
  - Calendar utilization metrics
  - Meeting pattern analysis
  - Team collaboration insights
  - Focus time calculations
- [ ] Verify charts and visualizations work correctly
- [ ] Test filtering and drill-down functionality
- [ ] Validate metric calculations

### Schema Evolution Support
- [ ] Ensure converters handle schema changes gracefully
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with existing data
- [ ] Validate forward compatibility for future enhancements
- [ ] Document any schema differences from Google Calendar

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test conversion performance with large datasets
- [ ] Validate memory usage during conversion
- [ ] Test concurrent conversion scenarios
- [ ] Benchmark against Google Calendar converter performance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Existing converters work correctly with Office 365 data OR
- [ ] Office 365-specific converters are implemented and tested
- [ ] All Office 365 calendar data integrates properly with Faros
- [ ] No data loss or corruption during conversion
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for production use
- [ ] Faros dashboards display Office 365 data correctly
- [ ] Integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Documentation updated for any converter-specific requirements
