## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements

**Every phase must follow strict TDD principles:**
1. **üî¥ RED**: Write failing tests first that define expected behavior
2. **üü¢ GREEN**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass  
3. **üîµ REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage

**Quality Gates Per Phase:**
- ‚úÖ **95%+ line coverage** for all production code
- ‚úÖ **100% branch coverage** for error handling paths
- ‚úÖ **All tests pass** before moving to next phase
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript strict mode** with zero warnings
- ‚úÖ **ESLint clean** with no rule violations

## Scope

Implement the Events converter for Office 365 Calendar that transforms Office 365 event data into Faros models with full feature parity to Google Calendar converter.

## Acceptance Criteria

### üî¥ Phase 1: Write Events Converter Tests FIRST

#### 1.1 Core Conversion Tests
- [ ] Create `test/converters/office365calendar/events.test.ts`:
  - [ ] Test basic event conversion (title, description, dates)
  - [ ] Test attendee conversion and user creation
  - [ ] Test organizer conversion and user creation  
  - [ ] Test location processing and geographic resolution
  - [ ] Test conference URL extraction (Teams, Zoom, etc.)
  - [ ] Test timezone handling and conversion
  - [ ] Test recurring event pattern processing

#### 1.2 Data Mapping Tests
- [ ] Test Office 365 ‚Üí Faros model field mapping:
  - [ ] `subject` ‚Üí `cal_Event.title`
  - [ ] `body.content` ‚Üí `cal_Event.description`
  - [ ] `start/end` ‚Üí proper datetime handling
  - [ ] `attendees` ‚Üí `cal_EventGuestAssociation` creation
  - [ ] `organizer` ‚Üí `cal_User` and event organizer reference
  - [ ] `location` ‚Üí `geo_Location` processing

#### 1.3 Edge Case Tests  
- [ ] Test malformed event data handling
- [ ] Test missing required fields
- [ ] Test timezone edge cases (DST transitions, etc.)
- [ ] Test large attendee lists (100+ attendees)
- [ ] Test recurring events with complex patterns
- [ ] Test location resolution failures
- [ ] Test conference URL parsing edge cases

#### 1.4 Performance Tests
- [ ] Test large event processing (1000+ events)
- [ ] Test memory usage during conversion
- [ ] Test user deduplication across events
- [ ] Test location caching effectiveness

### üü¢ Phase 2: Implement Events Converter (Make Tests Pass)

#### 2.1 Create Events Converter Class
- [ ] Create `src/converters/office365calendar/events.ts`:
  ```typescript
  export class Events extends Office365CalendarConverter {
    readonly destinationModels: ReadonlyArray<DestinationModel> = [
      'cal_Event',
      'cal_EventGuestAssociation', 
      'cal_User',
      'geo_Address',
      'geo_Coordinates',
      'geo_Location',
    ];
    
    async convert(record: AirbyteRecord, ctx: StreamContext): Promise<ReadonlyArray<DestinationRecord>> {
      // Implementation here
    }
  }
  ```

#### 2.2 Implement Core Conversion Logic
- [ ] **Event Record Creation**: Map Office 365 event to `cal_Event` model
- [ ] **User Management**: Create `cal_User` records for attendees and organizers
- [ ] **Guest Associations**: Create `cal_EventGuestAssociation` for each attendee
- [ ] **Date/Time Processing**: Handle Office 365 datetime formats and timezones
- [ ] **Status Mapping**: Map Office 365 event statuses to Faros categories

#### 2.3 Implement Location Processing
- [ ] **Location Extraction**: Parse location from Office 365 event data
- [ ] **Geographic Resolution**: Use LocationCollector for address resolution
- [ ] **Location Caching**: Implement efficient location caching
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of location resolution failures

#### 2.4 Implement Conference URL Processing  
- [ ] **Teams URL Extraction**: Parse Microsoft Teams meeting links
- [ ] **Zoom URL Extraction**: Parse Zoom meeting links from event data
- [ ] **Generic URL Processing**: Handle other conference platforms
- [ ] **Fallback Logic**: Use location field if it contains URLs

#### 2.5 Implement User Deduplication
- [ ] **User ID Generation**: Consistent user ID creation logic
- [ ] **Deduplication Tracking**: Track users seen across events
- [ ] **User Data Merging**: Merge user data from multiple sources
- [ ] **Memory Optimization**: Efficient user tracking for large datasets

### üîµ Phase 3: Refactor Events Converter (Maintain Test Coverage)

#### 3.1 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Optimize for large event datasets
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Minimize memory usage during conversion
- [ ] **Async Processing**: Optimize asynchronous operations
- [ ] **Caching Strategies**: Implement efficient caching patterns

#### 3.2 Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods
- [ ] **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

#### 3.3 Feature Completeness
- [ ] **Recurring Events**: Complete recurring event pattern support
- [ ] **Custom Fields**: Handle Office 365-specific fields
- [ ] **Privacy Settings**: Respect privacy and sensitivity settings
- [ ] **Attachment Handling**: Process event attachments if present
